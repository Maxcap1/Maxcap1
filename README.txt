Product Definition: A supplementary feature to already existing corporation apps, (such as the Starbucks or Mcdonalds apps) that tell the user how congested a certain franchise is in comparison to a different local franchise (of the same company). This will aid both the customer by saving their time, and the corporation by maximizing profit by not losing customers to long wait times.
